The containers seem to get their uptime and disk information straight from host instead of their own container.

Since for me it showed that uptime is some ~2 hours, but the container has been running only for a minutes.

Also the available disk space for me is ~940G, which shows the 1Tb M2 disk. This indicates that the container
stores its data on the host machines disk and doesn't have some separate disk storage. This is different when
comparing to VM's for example.

The processes seem to be unique for the containers and they do not share the processes with host machine.

Also the IP is unique.
